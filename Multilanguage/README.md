# Multilanguage

Read the game in two languages at once. (Any language of your choice + English original)

Text is now displayed on two extra-wide lines, with translation first and English second.

It is recommended to change the `MAX_LENGTH_TL` variable at the top of `multilanguage.js` depending on whether your language uses full-width characters (like Chinese/Korean/Japanese). Recommended value is `50` for full-width, `100` for Latin alphabet.

### Future improvements?

Select any two languages, instead of having one of them be English.
